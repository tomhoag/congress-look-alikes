# Congress Look Alikes

So how much does congress look like itself?  

Using the resources found @ https://github.com/unitedstates/images & https://theunitedstates.io/  and making use of [opencv](https://github.com/opencv/opencv), [dlib](https://github.com/davisking/dlib) and [face_recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition#face-recognition) and a few other libs, some code from [Adrian](https://www.pyimagesearch.com) and [Adam](https://medium.com/@ageitgey), I cobbled together this little project.

The results might still be available:
